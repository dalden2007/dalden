        The Road
    </h1>
    <p style="font-family: IBM Plex Mono" class="the-road-a">by Cormac McCarthy</p>
    <p style="font-family: IBM Plex Mono" class="the-road-p"> This post-apocalyptic novel is about the journey between a father and his son in a barren, dilapidated world where the cataclysmic event that caused it is left unexplained. It strongly displays the perseverance of love in a world that lacks it. This is especially seen in the fathers motive to stay alive is purely fueled for his personal duty to protect and care for his son. Love is not just the only important theme, but fear and bravery play a huge role too. Given the father and boy’s situation, the father is commonly seen to take risks throughout their journey, whether it is deadly encounters with strangers, or looting abandoned houses, the novel keeps us in a state of tension throughout the story. Although the novel covers powerful themes of love, bravery, and fear, the book is not really plot based, as it seems to have a scattered structure of events instead. The plot is not too valued as it is more focused on the depiction between the father and sons moments of fear and joy they experience on their way. Overall, The Road is a cardinal reminder to us that even in a post-apocalyptic world where most of humanity is degraded to violence and brutality, there will always be a persevering soul somewhere to “carry the fire”.</p>
